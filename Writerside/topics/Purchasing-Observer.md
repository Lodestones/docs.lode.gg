> **Warning**  
> Observer completely overhauls possible event plugins, offering features that are usually separated into individual
> plugins.
> 
> Do not purchase Observer and expect it to work alongside other plugins. We will not provide support if a plugin
> collides with Observer.

> **Note**  
> If you do end up purchasing Observer and need to use another plugin that clashes with Observer, you can toggle certain
> features off so the other plugin can take over.
